                    <strong>Hello, I am Vojtěch Novotný and I like games.</strong>
                    <p>I like playing them and I love designing them.</p>
                    <p>Fortunatelly I live in Brno so hopefully I will get to make some soon.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                    I have been enjoying designing levels since I remember anything but
                    parrents never saw games as something good so I never considered seriously
                    doing it.
                    </p><p>
                    At school I was good at everything but for some reason I chose to study IT.
                    I think I chose IT because of games but I honestly have no idea. As I was
                    studying I kind of forgot about the idea that I could make games for a living.
                    The programming has shrunk for me to about the size of one web application with
                    a database. I was not enjoying the school and eventually dropped out. Only
                    when I was about to drop out I kind of remembered why I went there in the
                    first place. It was too late.
                    </p>
                    <p>Now I have no job and no degree, but I have passion. Which sounds pathetic
                    honestly, but maybe, just maybe I can make something off of it.</p>
