                    <strong>Hello, I am Vojtěch Novotný and I like games.</strong>
                    <p>I like playing them and I love designing them.</p>
                    <p>Fortunatelly I live in Brno so hopefully I will get to make some soon.</p>

                    <p>I love the though process that goes into it. Designing things for a user to have
                    a perfect balance of understanding and challenge or exploration. To be immersive with
                    their world and characters and story. To have fun mechanics that feel meaningful to the player
                    and have depth. I love complicated systems ala Path of Exile and the world building of
                    Hollow Knight, the PVP systems of World of Warcraft...</p>
                    <p>I bring this inspiration into my own creations, make something that is interesting to me and
                    then present it to the player. Something new and different. <a href="https://acaran101.wordpress.com/">(my blog)</a></p>

                    <p>Although I have spent a lot of my free time exploring game design but I never
                    considered it a viable career. It wasn't even on my mind when it comes to my future jobs.
                    It took me failing school due to lack of motivation and interest to realize
                    games were the reason I chose the school in the first place. By then though it was
                    of course too late.</p>
                    <p>Now I have no job and no degree. Bright future ahead...</p>
                    <p>But hey, at least I can dance...</p>

                    <h2>Dance</h2>
                    <p>In high school I discovered dancing and after a few years I finally landed
                    in the swing dance family. Since then it has become my religion. I love the
                    social aspects of it, the specific social setting and expectations. The dance
                    itself is often exciting, sometimes thrilling, sometimes chill, laid back.
                    Perfect way to spend the evening with some friends or meet some new people,
                    listen to some great music.</p>
                    <p>It's a great incentive to travell too.</p>
                    <p>Right before the covid-19 crisis started I had the oportunity to start teaching
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFZrGMB0yks">Lindy Hop</a> for one of the Brno based schools. Unfortunatelly 2020 had some special
                    plans for everyone and I don't know when I'll get back to it.</p>
