                    <p>Warcraft III editor was the first really powerful editor I have encountered and
                    I have spent countless hours in it designing various maps and map campains. It was
                    also my first encounter with programming (via extensive game event scripting) and
                    it has taught me all the basics.</p>

                        <p>Halls of Mei'Ikari was my third CTM project and the first one I actually released.
                        It wasn't particularly sucessful but also wasn't really bad. I didn't focus on
                        aestetics very much so the game didn't look partiularly great. I always specialized
                        in gameplay and level design but those are not something that gets your map going.
                        A map that is going to be successful has to stand out immediatelly.
                        </p>
                        <em>Good screenshots bring in people, good gameplay makes them stay and "subscribe"
                        for future works.</em>
                        <p>The CTM community is very much a community so another way to be successful is to be socially active in it.
                        As I am very introverted I never got very much into the community. I also felt that the community was
                        very touchy around certain subjects and I didn'd want to be part of the circlejerk.
                        That made me not very popular. (e.g. Relationship with the genre creator or the subject of death mechanics in the game.)</p>
