                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Vojtěch Novotný. I'm 24 years old and I love computers, music and dance.</p>
                <p>After graduating the 8-year high school Klvaňovo Gymnázium Kyjov with excelent grades, I decided to pursue computer science at the Faculty of Information Technology at the Brno University of Technology. But during my studies my interests shifted heavily and I temporarily lost interest in programing. I dropped out in third year and worked a variety of jobs, smaller and bigger including being a Dance Instructor. </p>
                <p>Unfortunatelly COVID-19 put an end to that life. It made me realize what I want in my life and what I will have to do to achieve it. I decided to finally pursue a career in software development.</p>
                <p>I still love dancing and music though. I would love to come back to teaching dance one day "after" the pandemic. I go social dancing as often as I can. I am even a part of a semiprofessional dance group. We perform in various venues and even plan to compete at the European Championship, if it doesn't get canceled. In what little time I have left I play my guitar and try to keep myself physically fit and healthy. You probably won't find me in the gym but you might run into me at a local bouldering crag with climbing shoes on and smudges of chalk all over.</p>
